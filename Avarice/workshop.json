  "Title": "Avarice - Mutation Theft!",
  "Description": "This mod adds 3 separate mutations, designed to be synergistic but clearly overpowered; but how overpowered is up to you!\n\nAvarice\nThis mod lets you walk up to any creature in Qud and steal their attributes and mutations! Even ones only accessable to NPCs! Options include attribute theft chance, mutation theft chance, cooldown rate, and stealing at random versus picking which mutation to steal.\n\nQuiet Mind\nClearly with all the Ego and mutations you end up strutting around with, those psychic assassins will get to be pretty annoying; this mutation reduces the chances by which you encounter them!\n\nGenesight\nIt'd be a pain to figure out who has something worth stealing by constantly putting your big ticket ability on cooldown, so here is a way to tell at a glance what mutations anyone has up their sleeves! Has an option for range.",
